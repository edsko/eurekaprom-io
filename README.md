# Working with the EurekaPROM in IO mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in early alpha stages. Not yet ready for use.

This contains three projects:

* A Haskell library for writing applications that work with the EurekaPROM.
* Various Haskell applications for using the EurekaPROM: one to turn it into
  a general computer controller, and one to generate MIDI sequences that
  control the LEDs on the FCB1010 (useful in other applications).
* A Max for Live device for using the FCB1010 with the EurekaPROM in Ableton.
