# `InterpretPedals`

> [!NOTE]
> This is currently a bare-bones device only.

This is a Max for Live device for use in Ableton Live, which interprets the
signals from the [FCB1010](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0715-AAA#),
using the [EurekaPROM](https://www.eurekasound.com/eurekaprom) chip in
[IO mode](https://www.eurekasound.com/eurekaprom/io).

Currently it only interprets pedal 1 as a sustain pedal.
